          As a conclusion, we can derive that Romania was not that active in the past. We can say that, since we escaped from our communist era (this action happened the year of 1989) we started to develop more curiosity towards the astronomy science field. In the early years of 2000, big amounts of money were invested in Astronomy centers and since 2012, we have been contributing to the international society of astronomers. Every single year we have made discoveries of at least one star, which has a big impact towards our overall implication in Astronomy. We know that, compared to other countries, we might be quite insignificant, but we can safely say that we proved that we can contribute to this field too.
